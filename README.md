### Potential Issues viewing 

- When creating this project I was unaware that the ```normalize.css``` needed to be placed before my ```meow-landing.css``` stylesheet.  

### Respomnsivness in Project 

- I decided to change the background form white to black on smaller screens, through ```@media```, makes it easier to read in dark places on small screens.

- The drop down navigation menu accessed by the hamburger menu, changes layout through ```@media```, thus making scroll viewing easier.

- The Profile Gallery photo break was created with ```@media```, going directly from three rows to one.
